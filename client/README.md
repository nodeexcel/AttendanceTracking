# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can execute:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will refresh automatically when changes are made.\
You might also notice lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It properly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for maximum performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration options, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will reference the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. From this point on, you're on your own.

You never have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small to medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be as useful if you couldn't customize it when needed.
